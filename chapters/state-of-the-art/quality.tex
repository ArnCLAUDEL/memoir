\section{Quality}\label{sec:quality}
We've talked about Software Craftsmanship and Extreme Programming,
one is a culture, the other is a methodology but both focus on Quality.
\\
This chapter will first present the metrics given by the code analysis
tool Sonar and how we can use it during the refactoring phase.
Then we'll present a bunch of principles and design rules that
are used to improve the code quality and ease the maintenance.

\subsection{Sonar}\label{subsec:sonar}

Sonar is a static code analysis tool, this means that it inspects
directly the source code and try to find some potential bugs, security
holes, duplicated code and code smells.
It is based on a huge repository of rules and common good practices.
Each rule comes with a description and good/bad examples. \\
After the analysis, Sonar gives a global grade (A, B, C etc.) and
publishes a detailed report with every broken rules.
In a CI platform, sonar analysis must be performed for every commit and
developers must keep an eye on the report. \\
\newline
Any broken rule during the analysis will create an issue in the report.
There are three types of issues :

\begin{description}
    \item[Bug :]
    An issue that represents something wrong in the code.
    If this has not broken yet, it will, and probably at the worst
    possible moment.
    This needs to be fixed.
    Yesterday.
    \item[Vulnerabilty :]
    A security-related issue which represents a backdoor for attackers.
    \item[Code Smell :]
    A maintainability-related issue in the code.
    Leaving it as-is means that at best maintainers will have a harder
    time than they should making changes to the code.
    At worst, they'll be so confused by the state of the code that
    they'll introduce additional errors as they make changes.
\end{description}

Every issue have 5 level of severity :

\begin{description}
    \item[BLOCKER :]
Bug with a high probability to impact the behavior of the application
in production: memory leak, unclosed JDBC connection, ....
The code MUST be immediately fixed.
    \item[CRITICAL :]
Either a bug with a low probability to impact the behavior of the
application in production or an issue which represents a
security flaw: empty catch block, SQL injection, \ldots
The code MUST be immediately reviewed.
    \item[MAJOR :]
Quality flaw which can highly impact the developer productivity:
uncovered piece of code, duplicated blocks, unused parameters,
    \ldots
    \item[MINOR :]
Quality flaw which can slightly impact the developer productivity:
lines should not be too long, "switch" statements should have at
least 3 cases, \ldots
    \item[INFO :]
Neither a bug nor a quality flaw, just a finding.
\end{description}

We are not going to detail deeply Sonar rules, there're too many of them,
this actually why Sonar exists.
Programmers are humans and they can easily leave an unused variable, an
opened resource, forget to check for a likely null value or add an if
statement with a condition that is always false. \\
Sonar is great companion that integrates perfectly with IDEs and will
necessarily teach something new to anyone using it.
