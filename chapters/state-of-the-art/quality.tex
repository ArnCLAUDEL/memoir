\section{Quality}\label{sec:quality}
We've talked about Software Craftsmanship and Extreme Programming,
one is a culture, the other is a methodology but both focus on Quality. \\
This chapter will first present the metrics given by the code analysis
tool Sonar and how we can use it during the refactoring phase.
Then we'll present a bunch of principles and design rules that
are used to improve the code quality and ease the maintenance.
