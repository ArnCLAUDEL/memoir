Extreme Programming (XP) is a well known agile methodology, created by
Kent Beck.
The first projects using XP started in 1996.
We are not going to deeply present the methodology but at least we are
going to state the main values and detail the features that could be
relevant to our solution.

\begin{description}
    \item[Simplicity :] Minimum effort for maximum value. \\
    The idea is to always turn complex situations in small simple steps,
    making them easy to implement and reducing the cost of failure.
    \item[Commmunication :] Daily face to face between every team member. \\
    Everyone on a team works jointly at every stage of the project.
    \item[Feedback :] Constant and Early feedback on the product. \\
    Frequent demo of the product in order to always have a software that
    matches the current requirements.
    \item[Respect :] Simple respect between project members. \\
    They all have the same goal of delivering the greatest project.
    \item[Courage :] Objectivity and Transparency at any time. \\
    Never hide potential failures, lie on project's advancement. \\
    We don't document excuses for failure because we plan to succeed.

\subsection{Test Driven Development}\label{subsec:test-driven-development}

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a very interesting methodology for writing
tests.
Uncle Bob describes TDD with 3 rules :

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\item You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make
a failing unit test pass.
\item You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient
to fail;
and compilation failures are failures.
\item You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient
to pass the one failing unit test.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

These rules are very restrictive and they don't look very natural of what we
are use to.
There is a method that allow us to easily follow these rules, the Red Green
Refactor. \\
\newline
First you need to write a failing test and see the red light.
But your test cannot even run, they don't compile because there is actually
no production code.
So you create your class with empty methods in order to be able to run the
test. \\
And now you have a red light. \\
\newline
This red light must disappear as soon as possible, so you have to write
the minimum amount of code required to turn the light green.
The minimum means that you are rushing to the green light, duplicated code,
hardcoded values or worst if you want, the code simply need to work. \\
Now you've reached the green light. \\
\newline
Here you have a terrible (but working) code.
All you have to do now is refactoring, eliminating duplication,
extracting methods, variables, constants etc.
You don't have the fear anymore of breaking the feature while refactoring,
your fresh test will cover you for this. \\
Now you have a clean and working code, you can write a new failing test and
repeat the process again. \\
\newline
TDD allows programmers to be confident with their tests because they
describe how the production code should behave.
The production code was written only to make these tests pass, so if one test
fails again, it's because something has been broken somewhere and there is a
regression.
The incremental approach, using baby steps, is also very important in
the process.
Breaking a complex problem in smaller simple problem is a common good
practice.
