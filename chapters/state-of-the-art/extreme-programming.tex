\section{Extreme Programming}\label{sec:extreme-programming}
Extreme Programming (XP) is a well known agile methodology, created by
Kent Beck.
The first project using XP was created started March 6, 1996.
We are not going to deeply present the methodology but at least we are
going to state the values.

\begin{description}
    \item[Simplicity :] Minimum effort for maximum value. \\
    The idea is to always turn complex problem in small simple steps,
    making them easy to implement and reducing the cost of failure.
    \item[Commmunication :] Daily face to face communication between
    every team member. \\
    Everyone on a team works jointly at every stage of the project.
    \item[Feedback :] Constant and Early feedback on the product. \\
    Frequent demo of the product in order to always have a product that
    matches the current requirements.
    \item[Respect :] Simple respect between project members. \\
    They all have a common goal of delivering the greatest project.
    \item[Courage :] Objectivity and Transparency at any time. \\
    Never hide potential failures, lie on project's advancement. \\
    We don't document excuses for failure because we plan to succeed.
\end{description}

These values are very at the heart of XP and we can now go deeper into some
important features of XP that are relevant to our problematic.
