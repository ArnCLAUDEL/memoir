% TODO source from BDD in action
% TODO originally designed as an improved version of TDD

\subsection{Key concepts}\label{subsec:key-concepts}

% TODO intro

\subsubsection{Focus on business value}
% TODO don't try to specify everything
% TODO ongoing conversations with users / stakeholders
% TODO progressively build the software with business value
% TODO understand the feature and core business goals

\subsubsection{Work together}
% TODO collaborative practice between BA, dev and testers
% TODO stop to written requirements that need to be understood
% TODO don't tell what they need, let them design the solution
% TODO common sens of ownership

\subsubsection{Embrace uncertainty}
% TODO remove this section if it's too long
% TODO assume that the requirements will change
% TODO early feedback as much as possible
% TODO feature prioritization

\subsubsection{Features with concrete examples}
% TODO help to define and understand the feature
% TODO share a common vocabulary
% TODO old written specs are easily misunderstood
% TODO feature exploration is great, especially for testing

\subsubsection{Executable specifications}
% TODO tells objectively when the feature is done
% TODO serves as guideline
% TODO one it works, it turns immediately as a non regression test

\subsubsection{Living documentation}
% TODO always up-to-date
% TODO easy to read and better for newcomers
% TODO examples are better than pages of specification
% TODO easier for the maintainers
% TODO easier to change an existing feature
% TODO fix or delete a broken scenario

\subsection{Benefits}\label{subsec:benefits}
% TODO reduced cost by only adding relevant features
% TODO easier to change an existing feature
% TODO automated tests

\subsection{Limits}\label{subsec:limits}
% TODO requires high collaboration
% TODO works better in agile
% TODO doesn't work well in silo because of the poor communication
% TODO doesn't work well because QA comes late
% TODO can be costly if not written correctly
