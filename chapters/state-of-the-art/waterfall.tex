%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model#History
The waterfall methodology was first introduced in the 1950's by Mr.
Benington but was only formalized in 1970 by  Winston W. Royce.
This methodology has been widely used in the industry, although it received
a lot of criticism.

This section will first present the detailed workflow followed by the key
concepts of this methodology.
After that, we'll point out the weaknesses of the model and present a
improved version of the model: the V-model.
Finally, we'll state the residual problems and limits of the improved model.
