We've presented some traditional methods such as the waterfall methodology or
the v-model and showed their limits.
We covered some agile methodologies, such as XP and BDD, that tackle these
limits.

We then proposed a new solution that cherry picked some agile principles and
methods to integrate them into a more traditional and document-oriented
workflow.

This will increase the confidence of the team regarding the project, its
tests and codebase.
Now the team won't be afraid of modifying and improving the project because
we created strong harness to detect bugs and regressions as soon as possible.
