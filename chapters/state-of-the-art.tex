This chapter presents a detailed overview of the state of the art in the
domains of Quality and Testing. \\
We'll start with an introduction to the culture of Software Craftsmanship,
which is closely related to our problematic because it aims to solve this
specific kind of issues.  \\
Then we'll see some important features of Extreme Programming (XP) that
will be used in our solution.
We said earlier that both the problematic and the solution were not
specific to Agile, but it appears that some XP's features are completely
relevant in non-agile context, such as waterfall. \\
After that, we'll detail the domain of Quality, with a lot of important
principles and useful metrics. \\
We'll then cover the domain of Testing with the methodologies used to
write test, common types of test and their associated tools. \\
Finally, we'll have a word about Automation, why it is important and
present one of the most popular automation tool.
