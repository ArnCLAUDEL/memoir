This chapter will cover the state of the art in the domain of Quality in
waterfall software management.
We'll present the key concepts of the waterfall methodology with the pros and
cons.
Then we'll see how it was improved by the V-Model and the limits of the
solution.
These problems are mostly tackled by Agile methodology, so we'll highlight
some of its principles and methods that we can reuse in our waterfall context.
Finally, as a transition, we'll quickly compare agile and non-agile
methodologies, to show why we don't simply switch to agility and want to stay
in our waterfall context.
