This introduction will detail the problematic by defining what is
\textit{Quality} in a software project and what low-quality projects are

We will then define the relevant project contexts for this problematic.
Finally, we will justify the choice of this problematic by describing the
current context in my company and my personal experiences in the area of
Quality and Testing.
