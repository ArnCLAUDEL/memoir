This introduction will detail the problematic and show why there are
still projects with a low level of quality and no strong tests.
We will also define the relevant contexts where the solution of this
problematic is suitable.
Finally, I will justify the choice of this problematic by describing my
current context in my company and my personal experiences in the area of
Quality and Testing.
\section{Detailed Problematic}\label{sec:detailed-problematic}
There are a wide variety of IT projects, with differents programming
languages, methodologies and business domain.
Practices change frequently over time, new technologies or methods arise,
some fall after several years, some are broadly used and are even older
than the programmers that use them. \\
Quality and Testing concerns are not new. Prior to 2000, there was already
projects with a very high level of quality and strong automated tests, but
it was very uncommon at this time. In the early 2000's, a lot of new
methodologies and tools emerged in order to solve problems that
programmers used to encounter. \\
In the 2010's, these methods and tools became mature and were in a
lot of projects. More and more blogs or conferences were presenting them,
how to use them or introduce them in a legacy project. The community grew
and now a day it's almost a standard in new mainstream projects. \\
\newline
However, even with the great enthusiasm of the community, there are still
projects where programmers, managers and clients are not convinced by
those methodologies and technologies and keep doing it the old way. \\
Poor design, no refactoring nor code reviews, no unit testing, minimum
manual functionnal tests, heterogenous environements etc. The list can
be very long, so do for the consequences. In the worst case, people give up
and accept those bad practices so they become part of the normal process. \\
Sometimes, it's hard to see the value of a tool that, at first glance, only
cost a lot of efforts, time and therefore money, for no extra business value.
The benefits in a long run are generally ignored or under estimated.
The change of the team's habits does have a cost, requires new trainings,
new processes, some extra management for the new methodologies and
extra maintenance for the new tools. But this is a necessary mean, an
investment for the long run in order to increase the overall quality and
prevent the project from regressions.
