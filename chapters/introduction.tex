This introduction will detail the problematic and show why there are
still projects with a low level of quality with almost no test.
We will also define the relevant contexts where the proposed solution
of this problematic is suitable.
Finally, I will justify the choice of this problematic by describing the
current context in my company and my personal experiences in the area of
Quality and Testing.
\section{Detailed Problematic}\label{sec:detailed-problematic}
There are a wide variety of IT projects, with different programming
languages, methodologies and business domains.
Practices change frequently over time, new technologies arise,
some disapear after several years, some are broadly used and are even older
than the programmers that use them. \\
Quality and Testing concerns are not new.
Prior to 2000, there was already projects with a very high level of quality
and strong automated tests, but it was very uncommon at this time.
In the early 2000's, a lot of new methodologies and tools emerged in order
to solve problems that programmers used to encounter. \\
In the 2010's, these methods and tools became mature and were in a
lot of projects.
More and more blogs, conferences or training were created to present them,
to show how to use them and introduce them in a legacy project.
The community grew and now a day they are almost a standard in new mainstream
projects. \\
\newline
However, even with the great enthusiasm of the community, there are still
projects where programmers, managers and clients are not convinced by
those methodologies and technologies and keep doing it the old way. \\
Poor design, no refactoring nor code reviews, no unit testing, minimum
manual functional tests, heterogeneous environments etc.
The list can be very long, so do for the consequences.
In the worst case, people give up and accept those bad practices so they
integrate them as part of the normal process. \\
Sometimes, it's hard to see the value of a tool that, at first glance, only
cost a lot of efforts, time and therefore money, for no extra business value.
The benefits in a long run are generally ignored or under estimated.
The change of the team's habits does have a cost, requires new trainings,
new processes, some extra management for the new methodologies and
extra maintenance for the new tools.
But this is a necessary mean, an investment for the long run in order to
increase the overall quality and prevent the project from disaster. \\
\newline
The solution of this problematic starts therefore by correctly understanding
the features of existing methods and tools and then show how to easily
integrate them all into a project.
