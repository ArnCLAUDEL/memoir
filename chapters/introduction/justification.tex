\section{Justification}\label{sec:justification}
This section explains why I have chosen this problematic by describing
my company context, important experiences and my personal interests. \\
I've been working in my company for one year and a half, on several
projects, for different clients and on different sites.
I worked on both back-end and front-end, mostly using Java and Javascript where
there're often a lot of modules, components, environments, teams and of course
a lot of legacy code.

The definition of quality on these projects was not exactly the same as mine.
The only thing that matters was almost always a working feature, no matter
what.
And once it worked, you had to let it as it was to avoid regression or new
bugs.

Tests were almost fully manual, made and run by business analysts.
This is why people were afraid of refactoring, it's because it requires to
run the tests again to ensure that there's no regression.
Test automation was not very common, some prototypes were made but quickly
abandoned.
Tests were therefore costly and inherently unreliable.

Beside my projects where I understood why Quality and Testing are
important, I also attended to, in my opinion the best class of my
training, the Agile class by M. Zam.
This class was a very broad overview of methods, techniques, tools and a
lot of buzzwords that help to create better software.
I would rename this class as Software Craftsmanship, because it is a
bunch of good practices and real life complex methods that are usually
used only by Software Crafters.

I was very sceptical by what he showed us, because it seemed very complex
and not natural at all.
Things such as TDD, Pair Programming, DDD were completely different of
what I was used to.
I couldn't understand why people were talking so much about that, how can
people could even work with these methods.

So I tried to see what others do, and the best way I found was Meetup.
Meetup are small events, usually with several talks but sometimes you
simply code with other people and you make some tricky exercises or
discover new technologies.
I realized that these unusual methods were actually very common and that
it only depends on you to work with the people you want to.

This problematic was perfectly suited for me. \\
First of all, I'm very interested in these Quality and Testing concerns,
so I can learn new things, methods, tools about it and see how common
problems are tackled. \\
Second, I was a bit tired of working on the same thing in my project and
I heard that they wanted to work on test automation.
So this problematic could help me to switch to a fresh mission that keeps
me in the mood. \\
Finally, I think that it will be very helpful for me later, in my future
job.
I can learn a lot of new methods and technologies that are used in the
real world and be better prepared to work with.
